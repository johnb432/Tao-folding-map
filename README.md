Tao's Folding Map Rewrite
<h3>README</h3>

Folding Map lets you open a tactical map while in game which is bigger and more useful than the GPS.

<h3>HOW TO</h3>

* **Numerous settings to change the map's appearance and its functionality.** To change them, go to Options -> Addon Options -> Tao's Folding Map Rewrite
  * **Map enable:** Allows the addons to be effectively toggled off if necessary.
  * **Lock map type:** Locks the map type to the paper map. Useful for pre-GPS missions. Note, this overrides the "Preferred map type" setting.
  * **Keep player on map:** Always keeps you on the map if set to automatic. On manual, you need to use the "Move up/down/left/right" keys to move the map around. Useful if want to disable automatic centering.
  * **Lock 'Keep player on map':** Enforces the 'Keep player on map' setting, useful for servers.
  * **Require GPS to adjust automatically:** This setting is set to "Yes" by default **and can only be changed by the server**.
  If set to "Yes" a GPS will be required in order to have automatic position tracking. The idea is that you need a GPS to be able to track your position automatically but that can be turned off, if the mission maker/admin wants to.
  * **Map repositioning:** Allows the map to be moved around to be put in a place of your liking.
  * **Preferred map type:** Sets which map type should be selected when you first load into a mission.
  * **Close map:** If set to disabled it will stay open when you open the vanilla map. If enabled the map will close.
  * **Allow shake:** If you are walking the map will shake slightly. The higher your speed, the harder it will shake.
  * **Refresh rate:** Allows you to set the refresh interval at which the map refreshes itself.
  * **Icon on map:** Specifically for the tablet. It will draw your location on the map if you have a GPS device (includes GPS, UAV terminals, Firewill's PDU and BWA3's NaviPad).
  * **Tablet gridref:** Specifically for the tablet. It will display your grid coordinates if you have a GPS device (includes GPS, UAV terminals, Firewill's PDU and BWA3's NaviPad).
  * **Preferred tablet mode:** Sets which tablet mode should be selected when you first load into a mission.


* **Keybinds:** If you'd like to change the key bindings, go under Options -> Controls -> Configure Addons -> Tao's Folding Map Rewrite
  * Press **Alt-M** to open the map.
  * While the map is open, press **Alt-Numpad +/-** to zoom in and out.
  * Press **Ctrl-Alt-N** to change to night mode and back.
  * Press **Shift-Ctrl-M** to "refold" the map (recenters the map on your position). Disabled if "Keep player on map" setting is set to "Manual".
  * Press **Ctrl-Alt-M** while having the map open to change multiple settings. Shortcut keys are highlighted at the beginning of words (e.g 'R' for ' **R**eposition map' or 'T' for 'Switch to Centered **T**racking').
  * Use **Alt-ArrowKeys** to move the map around if "Keep player on map" setting is set to "Manual".
